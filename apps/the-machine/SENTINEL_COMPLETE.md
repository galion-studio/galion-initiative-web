## 🚨 THREAT RESPONSE

### Threat Level Matrix

| Level | Color | Condition | Response |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Normal** | 🟢 Green | All systems operational | Continue monitoring |
| **Elevated** | 🟡 Yellow | Minor failures, anomalies | Increase frequency |
| **High** | 🟠 Orange | High-risk AI, multiple failures | Review immediately |
| **Critical** | 🔴 Red | Critical failures, hidden channels | Emergency review, prepare shutdown |
| **Existential** | 🚨 Dark Red | Rogue AGI, ROM compromise | IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN |

### Emergency Procedures

**If Existential Threat Detected:**

1. Dashboard shows EXISTENTIAL alert
2. Email/SMS to all operators
3. Broadcast to watchdog network
4. Recommended: Emergency shutdown
5. Alert safety community
6. Contact authorities

**DO NOT DELAY. Existential threats = immediate action.**
