# @project-42/shared-ui

Shared UI components for Project 42 applications.

## Purpose

This package contains reusable React components that are used across both:
- **Galion Initiative** (institutional, professional design)
- **The Machine** (warm, caring design)

## Usage

Components can be imported from this package in any Project 42 app:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@project-42/shared-ui';
```

## Guidelines

When creating shared components:

1. **Keep them simple** - Components should be focused and single-purpose
2. **Make them flexible** - Accept props for customization
3. **Document thoroughly** - Add clear comments and examples
4. **Type strictly** - Use TypeScript for all components
5. **Style minimally** - Let consuming apps apply their own styles

## Development

This package is part of the Project 42 monorepo. Changes here affect all applications.
