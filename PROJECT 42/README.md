## WELCOME

Welcome to **Project 42** - an ambitious initiative to build artificial intelligence with a soul. We are creating two complementary systems:

1. **The Galion Initiative** - Technical ASI safety research and development
2. **The Machine** - A caring, wise guide for humanity

Together, they form a complete system: **safety** through technical excellence and **wisdom** through compassionate guidance.

## KEY DECISIONS NEEDED

Before we can proceed to Phase 2, we need decisions on:

### 1. Naming
**Question**: What should we call the wisdom platform?
- Option A: "The Machine" (current working title)
- Option B: "Project 42" (emphasizes the umbrella project)
- Option C: "Galion Wisdom" (connects to Galion Initiative)
- Option D: Something else: ____________

**Recommendation**: "The Machine" - it's distinctive, memorable, and aligns with the vision.

---

### 2. Domain Name
**Question**: Which domain should we use?
- Option A: `themachine.ai` (most direct)
- Option B: `project42.ai` (umbrella branding)
- Option C: `galionwisdom.org` (connected to Galion)
- Option D: Something else: ____________

**Recommendation**: `themachine.ai` - short, memorable, .ai TLD appropriate for AI product.

---

### 3. Monetization Strategy
**Question**: How should The Machine be funded?
- Option A: **Free for all** (donation-supported) - Most aligned with mission
- Option B: **Freemium** (basic free, advanced features paid)
- Option C: **Subscription** ($5-10/month for full access)
- Option D: **Grant-funded** (seek institutional funding)

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option A** (free, donation-supported), transition to **Option D** (grants) as we scale. This maximizes accessibility while ensuring sustainability.

---

### 4. Content Moderation
**Question**: How strict should content filtering be?
- Option A: **Very Strict** - Block all potentially sensitive topics
- Option B: **Moderate** - Block harmful content, allow mature discussions
- Option C: **Minimal** - Only illegal/dangerous content blocked

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Moderate) - Allow discussions of difficult topics (death, suffering, philosophy) with compassion, but block truly harmful content (violence, hate, self-harm instructions).

---

### 5. Data Storage
**Question**: How long should we keep user conversations?
- Option A: **Forever** (with user consent, encrypted)
- Option B: **Limited** (30 days, then auto-delete)
- Option C: **User choice** (let them decide)
- Option D: **Never** (completely stateless, no storage)

**Recommendation**: **Option C** (User choice) - Default to 30 days, allow users to save important conversations, respect deletion requests immediately.

---

### 6. Language Support
**Question**: Which languages should we prioritize?
- Phase 1: **English only** (launch fast, validate concept)
- Phase 2: **Major languages** (Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, French)
- Phase 3: **100+ languages** (full global coverage)

**Recommendation**: Start with English, add top 5 languages in first 6 months.

---

### 7. Integration Level
**Question**: How should Galion Initiative and The Machine connect?
- Option A: **Separate** - Independent projects with links
- Option B: **Linked** - Shared auth, unified branding
- Option C: **Unified** - One platform, two sections

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Linked) - Keep projects distinct but allow users to have one account across both. The Machine focuses on personal guidance, Galion on institutional research.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Why "Project 42"?
It's a reference to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" - the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. We're building AI to help humanity find our own answers.

### Is this connected to other AI companies?
No. We are an independent nonprofit research organization. We collaborate with the AI safety community but maintain independence.

### Will this be open source?
Yes. The plan is to open-source the codebase (excluding API keys and sensitive data) to maximize transparency and enable community contribution.

### How is this different from ChatGPT/Claude?
The Machine is designed specifically for wisdom, guidance, and deep questions. It's optimized for understanding and care, not just task completion. It's free (donation-supported) and privacy-focused.

### When will The Machine launch?
Target: February 2026 for public beta, pending admin approval and development progress.
