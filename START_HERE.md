# 🚀 START HERE - Project 42

## Welcome to Your New Infrastructure!

I've completely restructured your project into a beautiful, professional **monorepo** that houses both **Galion Initiative** and **The Machine** at equal levels.

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd c:\Users\Gigabyte\Documents\galion-initiative-web
npm install
```

### 2. Test Galion Initiative
```bash
npm run dev:galion
```
Then visit: http://localhost:3000

### 3. Test The Machine
```bash
npm run dev:machine
```
Then visit: http://localhost:3001

## 📁 What's New?

### Two Equal Projects

**🏛️ Galion Initiative** (`apps/galion-initiative/`)
- Your existing production website
- Institutional design
- Safe AGI research platform
- Already deployed to galioninitiative.org

**💝 The Machine** (`apps/the-machine/`)

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Read this file (you're doing it!)
2. ⚡ Run `npm install`
3. 🏛️ Test Galion Initiative: `npm run dev:galion`
4. 💝 Test The Machine: `npm run dev:machine`
5. 📖 Read `PROJECT_RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md` for full details

### Development
- Start building features for The Machine
- Add conversation AI
- Build knowledge base
- Create user accounts

### Deployment
- Keep Galion Initiative deployed (already done)
- Deploy The Machine when ready
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Development
- **Hot reload works** - Save files and see changes instantly
- **TypeScript strict mode** - Catch errors early
- **Shared packages** - Reuse code between projects
- **Independent deploys** - Each app deploys separately

### File Organization
- App-specific code goes in `apps/[app-name]/`
- Shared code goes in `packages/shared-*/`
- Documentation goes in `docs/` or root

### Workspace Commands
```bash
# Install package in specific app
npm install [package] -w apps/galion-initiative
npm install [package] -w apps/the-machine

# Run command in specific app
npm run [command] -w apps/galion-initiative
```

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

✅ **Professional Grade** - Enterprise-level monorepo
✅ **Two Beautiful Projects** - Both with distinct personalities
✅ **Code Sharing** - Don't repeat yourself
✅ **Independent** - Deploy separately
